// Requirements:
// R1: A thread acquiring a lock should eventually release the lock.
// R2: At most one thread can acquire a lock at a time.
// R3: A thread can only release a lock it has acquired.

prop basic :
  Forall t . Forall l .
    (
      (end -> ![acq(t,l),rel(t,l))) &
      (acq(t,l) -> ! exists s . @ [acq(s,l),rel(s,l))) &
      (rel(t,l) -> @ [acq(t,l),rel(t,l)))
    )
